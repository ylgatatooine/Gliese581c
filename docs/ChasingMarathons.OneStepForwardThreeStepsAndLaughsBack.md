So, there I was, running the Berlin Marathon 2023 last weekend, achieving a personal record. Picture me as a caffeinated cheetah on roller skates, zooming through the course with a negative split. That marked my 11th marathon, and I've collected more major marathons than hole-free socks. Let's just say, it's never just a race; it's an Abbott World Marathon Majors party, and I've had my share of fun!

My journey into chasing marathons didn't exactly start with a runner's high; in fact, I initially chickened out of my first marathon due to training issues and ended up running a half instead. To make matters worse, for the first three years, my marathon times seemed to be in an unhealthy competition with each other to see who could get worse the fastest.

But then, the pandemic hit, and suddenly, I went from being a taxi driver for my kids to being one with the couch. Determined not to become a full-fledged couch potato, I found myself running more laps around the house than the kids. To my surprise, I even had a PR during my very first pandemic run ‚Äì the Bank of America Chicago Marathon 2021!

But what made marathons truly unforgettable was that I ran one with my wife and another with my little sister, who were attempting their very first marathons. Who doesn't like a family reunion that involves 26.2 miles of running? Before the pandemic days, I flew all the way back to Wuhan to visit my elderly parents. Running a marathon was easier than navigating through airports' security, trust me.

Now, I didn't just run marathons; I stumbled into new friendships at the most unexpected times. I even made pals at running events in places as far-flung as Michigan, USA, or Berlin, Germany. Who knew that accidentally bumping into someone while gasping for air could be the secret to making longtime running buddies?

And let's not forget about the running relays. Hood To Coast Race Series 2023, anyone? Running with a team in a relay is like building a friendship fort out of sweat and running shoes. It's a bonding experience that makes you question your life choices but in a good way.

Of course, I'm not just a runner; I'm trying to be a scholar of the sport. I've devoured more running books than I have energy gels. From Alex Hutchinson's "Endure" to Chris McDougall's "Born to Run", I've learned that if you want to run faster, you have to, well, run faster. Who would've thought?

But the book that revolutionized my training schedule was "Run Less Run Faster" by Bill Pierce and Scott Murr. It's perfect for the enthusiastic amateur who can only run three times a week. Throw in some cross-training, and you've got a recipe for marathon success.

Of course, I've also learned a ton from fellow marathon runners. Take, for instance, that infamous Heartbreak Hill and the electrifying Scream Tunnel at the Boston Marathon. Trust me, I got the full experience (Not what you think!). But thanks to the wisdom of my fellow runners, I tackled them well. Maybe not pain-free, but at least I didn't sprint and enjoyed the experience!

Speaking of training, it's all about balance. Too much practice and unscientific training can spell disaster. My strategy? Well, it is a bit laissez-faire: stay fit, hope to get better, check my performance before races, and decide my marathon pace from there. Did it work? Well, ask Strava, the cheerleader ‚Äì because, believe me, Strava shows that I'm setting various records on almost every jog!

But let's get real for a moment. Marathons are not just about the body; they're about the mind and spirit. Rain, snow, or shine, getting out to run can be as fun as dental surgery. But when you see those fitness numbers stagnate, it's like a bad comedy show. You start questioning your devotion, your life choices, and your decisions to avoid the office donuts.

But then there's race day. There's no way to run 26.2 miles without pain. Lots of pain. It's like life; it's a marathon, not a sprint. In my early marathons, I prayed for strength and cursed the road. Now, I drew strength from devoting the conquering of the last few miles to people who matter most, in reverse order ‚Äî because family comes first, especially when you're running on fumes.

However, my best performance at 3:14 happened when I was deeply sleep-deprived, my brain shut down, and on auto-pilot. I guess the secret to a great marathon is running it like a zombie. Who knew?

So, what is running a marathon? Well, I'll tell you next time because, like the miles in a marathon, my answers are ever-evolving, usually accompanied by laughter, and occasionally a "Why did I do this again?" moment. But hey, that's the beauty of the journey! üèÉ
